# Support Vector Regression

## The difference between Support Vector Regression (SVR) and normal regression, and the intuition behind using different kernel functions.

Normal regression (e.g., linear regression) aims to find a function that minimizes the sum of the differences between the predicted values and the actual values. The primary focus is on minimizing the error in the predictions, which can make it sensitive to outliers and noise in the data. In linear regression, we fit a straight line to the data in 2D space.

SVR, on the other hand, doesn’t focus on minimizing the error. Instead, it tries to fit a function within an epsilon-insensitive tube around the actual values (ignoring the points inside the tube). The focus is on maximizing the margin between the function and the nearest data points outside the tube (support vectors). This approach makes SVR less sensitive to outliers and noise, and it can produce more robust models.

Now, let’s discuss the intuition behind using different kernel functions in SVR. In simple terms, kernel functions enable SVR to learn more complex, non-linear relationships between the predictor variables and the target variable.

While using a linear kernel results in a straight line (as shown in the previous example), using other kernel functions can generate different shapes in 2D space that capture more complex relationships in the data. For instance, a radial basis function (RBF) kernel can produce smooth curves or even a “bell-shaped” function, while a polynomial kernel can produce curved functions of varying degrees.

Visualizing the intuition behind non-linear kernel functions in SVR can be done by transforming a 2D scatter plot of the data (with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis) as follows:

1. Using a linear kernel, imagine fitting a straight line that lies within an epsilon-insensitive tube, while maximizing the margin between the line and the nearest data points outside the tube.

2. Using an RBF kernel, imagine fitting a smooth curve, and in some cases forming a “bell-shaped” function, that lies within the epsilon-insensitive tube, while maximizing the margin between the curve and the nearest data points outside the tube.

3. Using a polynomial kernel, imagine fitting a curved function of varying degrees (e.g., quadratic, cubic) that lies within the epsilon-insensitive tube, while maximizing the margin between the curve and the nearest data points outside the tube.

Using different kernel functions allows SVR to capture non-linear relationships between the predictor and target variables, and to create more flexible regression models. This adaptability to various types of data is what sets SVR apart from normal linear regression.


## imagine how using kernels will transform nonlinear data into a higher dimension where it becomes linear!
Consider a 2D scatter plot of the ten data points with x (feature) on the horizontal axis and y (target) on the vertical axis.

Because the RBF kernel is a non-linear kernel, it can handle complex relationships between the predictor and target variables. Essentially, it maps the data points to a higher-dimensional space where a linear separation becomes possible. However, the result of this transformation in the higher-dimensional space is a smooth curve when viewed in the original 2D space.

Now, let’s imagine fitting an RBF kernel-based SVR model to the data:

1. The RBF kernel takes a parameter called gamma, which controls the level of flexibility or smoothness in the fitted curve. A smaller gamma value results in a smoother curve while a larger gamma value creates a tighter (sharper) curve around the data points.

2. The SVR model tries to find a function that lies within an epsilon-insensitive tube, which we can visualize as a flexible “band” around the actual data points. The tube has a width defined by the epsilon value.

3. When using the RBF kernel, the SVR algorithm will produce a curved function that lies within this epsilon-insensitive tube, while maximizing the margin between the curve and the nearest data points outside the tube (support vectors).

4. In some cases, this curve can have multiple “peaks” or “valleys” as it tries to stay within the tube and capture more complex non-linear relationships in the data.

5. Because the RBF kernel can create smooth, “bell-shaped” curves, the SVR model may not pass directly through all data points. Instead, it will strike a balance between capturing the overall data pattern and staying within the epsilon-insensitive tube.


In a regression problem, we aim to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The RBF kernel can be used in kernel-based regression methods, such as kernel ridge regression or support vector regression (SVR), to model complex, nonlinear relationships between the input features and the target variable.
The idea behind using the RBF kernel in regression is similar to its use in classification. The kernel maps the input data points to a higher-dimensional space, where a linear model can be fitted to the transformed data. In the case of regression, this linear model is a hyperplane that best fits the transformed data points, minimizing the error between the predicted target values and the true target values.
To visualize this, imagine the same 2D scatter plot with the x-axis representing the input feature and the y-axis representing the target variable. The RBF kernel lifts the data points into a higher-dimensional space, creating a curved surface. In this higher-dimensional space, we can fit a linear model (a hyperplane) that best approximates the transformed data points.
Once the linear model is fitted in the higher-dimensional space, we can use it to make predictions for new input data points. To do this, we first map the new data points to the higher-dimensional space using the RBF kernel, and then apply the linear model to predict the target variable.

## python code for visualizing the effect
Here's a Python code example using Plotly to visualize a 2D nonlinear dataset, its transformation to a 3D space using the RBF kernel, and the fitting of a linear hyperplane in the 3D space. Note that this example uses synthetic data for demonstration purposes.
```python
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem

# Create synthetic nonlinear 2D data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=20, random_state=42)
y = y**2

# RBF kernel transformation
rbf_feature = Nystroem(gamma=0.1, random_state=42, n_components=2)
X_transformed = rbf_feature.fit_transform(X)

# Fit a linear model in the transformed 3D space
linear_model = LinearRegression()
linear_model.fit(X_transformed, y)

# Visualize the original 2D data
fig_2d = px.scatter(x=X[:, 0], y=y, title='Original 2D Nonlinear Data')
fig_2d.show()

# Visualize the transformed 3D data
fig_3d = px.scatter_3d(x=X_transformed[:, 0], y=X_transformed[:, 1], z=y, title='Transformed 3D Data')
fig_3d.show()

# Visualize the linear hyperplane in the 3D space
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(X_transformed[:, 0].min(), X_transformed[:, 0].max(), 20),
                     np.linspace(X_transformed[:, 1].min(), X_transformed[:, 1].max(), 20))
zz = linear_model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
zz = zz.reshape(xx.shape)

fig_hyperplane = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter3d(x=X_transformed[:, 0], y=X_transformed[:, 1], z=y,
                                              mode='markers', marker=dict(size=5)),
                                  go.Surface(x=xx, y=yy, z=zz, opacity=0.5)])
fig_hyperplane.update_layout(scene=dict(xaxis_title='X1', yaxis_title='X2', zaxis_title='y'),
                             title='Linear Hyperplane in 3D Space')
fig_hyperplane.show()

```
This code generates three visualizations:
The original 2D nonlinear data.
The transformed 3D data using the RBF kernel.
The linear hyperplane fitted in the 3D space.
Keep in mind that this example uses a kernel approximation method (Nystroem) to approximate the RBF kernel transformation, which allows us to visualize the transformed data in 3D. In practice, you might use the exact RBF kernel in a kernel-based regression method, such as kernel ridge regression or support vector regression, which would not require an explicit transformation of the data.


## another code for imagination

Here’s a Python code example to help you visualize the transformation of a simple 2D scatter plot of ten data points using an RBF kernel. I will create a toy dataset, apply a simple RBF kernel transformation, and then show how it maps the data points to a higher-dimensional space.

For this example, I will use a non-linear function to generate the data.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create a toy dataset
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
X = rng.uniform(0, 5, 10)[:, np.newaxis]
y = (np.sin(X.ravel()) + 0.5 * rng.randn(10))

# Perform RBF kernel transformation (manually)
def rbf_kernel(x1, x2, gamma=1):
    return np.exp(-gamma * np.linalg.norm(x1 - x2)**2)

# Create a higher-dimensional mapping using RBF kernel
gamma = 1
Phi = np.zeros((len(X), len(X)))
for i, x1 in enumerate(X):
    for j, x2 in enumerate(X):
        Phi[i, j] = rbf_kernel(x1, x2, gamma)

# Standardize the transformed data
scaler = StandardScaler()
Phi_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Phi)

# Plot the original 2D data
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.subplot(131)
plt.scatter(X, y, marker='o', c='r', label='Original 2D data')
plt.xlabel('x-axis')
plt.ylabel('y-axis')
plt.legend()

# Plot the original 2D data with transformed components
plt.subplot(132)
plt.scatter(X, y, marker='o', c='r', label='Original 2D data')
plt.scatter(X, Phi[:, 0], c='b', label='RBF 1st component')
plt.scatter(X, Phi[:, 1], c='g', label='RBF 2nd component')
plt.xlabel('x-axis')
plt.legend()

# Plot the transformed data in higher-dimensional space
plt.subplot(133)
plt.scatter(Phi[:, 0], Phi[:, 1], marker='o', c='b', label='Transformed data in higher-dimensional space')
plt.xlabel('First RBF component')
plt.ylabel('Second RBF component')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

To explain the transformation:

1. We create a toy dataset with non-linear data points (red points in the left plot).
2. Next, we apply an RBF kernel transformation manually, with gamma=1. The resulting mapped data points are computed using the RBF kernel and form a basis for a higher-dimensional space.
3. We then standardize the transformed data, which will ensure that the transformed features have zero mean and unit variance.
4. Finally, we plot the original 2D data (red points) along with the first two components of the transformed RBF space (blue and green points, middle plot), and the transformed data in the higher-dimensional space (blue points in the right plot).

You can see how the original 2D data points (red) are transformed into blue and green points using the RBF kernel. When we take the first two components of the transformed data (Phi[:, 0] and Phi[:, 1]), we can see a linearly separable pattern in the right plot that can be exploited by the SVR algorithm.

Keep in mind that this is a simple visualization of the transformation using a toy dataset. In practice, the RBF kernel can create more complex transformations depending on the data and the gamma parameter.
