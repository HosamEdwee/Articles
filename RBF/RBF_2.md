let’s dive into an important concept in the field of machine learning, the Gaussian Kernel Function, and its connection to infinite-dimensional space. Don’t worry, I’ll make it simple and easy to understand for all of you.

Before diving into the Gaussian Kernel, let’s refresh our memory about dot products. Dot products are used to compute the angle between two vectors. Given two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, their dot product is given by:

$$
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = ||\mathbf{A}|| ||\mathbf{B}|| \cos\theta
$$

Where $||\mathbf{A}||$ and $||\mathbf{B}||$ are the magnitudes of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, and $\theta$ is the angle between them.

Now let’s talk about kernels. Kernel is a concept that helps us transform the input data into a higher-dimensional space. It does so to enable better separation in classification problems or better fitting in regression applications without explicitly mapping the data into the higher-dimensional space.

One popular kernel function is the Gaussian Kernel Function, also known as the Radial Basis Function (RBF). It is given by:

$$
K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \exp\left(-\frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Where $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are data points, $||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance between the points $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, and $\sigma^2$ is a positive parameter. When we say that the Gaussian Kernel is related to infinite-dimensional space, we are referring to the feature space it implicitly maps the inputs to.

Here’s how the Gaussian Kernel relates to the infinite-dimensional space:

The Gaussian Kernel can be expressed as an infinite series using Taylor’s expansion:

$$
\exp\left(-\frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})^n
$$

Where $c_n$ are coefficients of the Taylor’s expansion and the summation is from $n=0$ to $n=\infty$.

Now, let’s define a mapping function $\phi$ that projects the input data $\mathbf{x}$ into the infinite-dimensional space:

$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \left[1, \sqrt{c_1}\, x_1, \sqrt{c_2}\, x_1^2, \sqrt{c_3}\, x_1^3, \ldots\right]
$$

The Gaussian Kernel can then be viewed as the dot product between the mapping into the infinite-dimensional space:

$$
K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \phi(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \phi(\mathbf{y})
$$

But we never actually compute $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ or $\phi(\mathbf{y})$ explicitly. The Gaussian Kernel helps us compute the dot product of the transformed points directly in the input space.

Mathematically, this is wonderfully fascinating because kernels, like the Gaussian Kernel, have provided us the ability to work in infinite-dimensional spaces without explicitly computing the transformed points. This allows us to handle complex, non-linear relationships between data points while still maintaining the ease of computation.

In summary, the Gaussian Kernel function is related to infinite-dimensional space through its mapping function, $\phi$, capable of taking data points from the input space and mapping them into an infinite-dimensional feature space. This can help us reveal complex relationships between data points while keeping computational efficiency intact. Isn’t that amazing?
