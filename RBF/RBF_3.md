Let’s break the steps down further to understand the connections better.

1. Start with the Gaussian Kernel Function:

$$
K(x, y) = \exp\left(-\frac{||x-y||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

2. Rewrite the Gaussian Kernel using the Taylor expansion of the exponential function:

$$
\exp(-z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n z^n}{n!}
$$

In our case, $z = \frac{||x-y||^2}{2\sigma^2}$

3. So, the Gaussian Kernel Function can be expressed as an infinite series:

$$
K(x, y) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \left(\frac{||x-y||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)^n
$$

Now, let’s define a mapping function $\phi$ that projects the input data $x$ into infinite-dimensional space. We’ll use the binomial theorem to help with the transition.

4. Recall the binomial theorem for $(a+b)^2$:

$$
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

5. Extend the binomial theorem to infinite dimensions by considering this relationship:

$$
(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2
$$

6. Now, let’s write down $x^2$ and $y^2$ as linear combinations of the aforementioned infinite series. This will help us get the coefficients of the Taylor’s expansion:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^{2n} = x^2
$$

$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n y^{2n} = y^2
$$

It’s important to understand that the actual mapping function, $\phi(x)$, comes from these infinite series representations of $x^2$ and $y^2$.

7. So, the mapping function $\phi(x)$ can be defined as:

$$
\phi(x) = \left[1, \sqrt{c_1}x, \sqrt{c_2}x^2, \sqrt{c_3}x^3, \ldots\right]
$$

Using this mapping function, we can rewrite the Gaussian Kernel as:

$$
K(x, y) = \phi(x) \cdot \phi(y)
$$

Although numerous steps occur in between, the key to understanding the connection comes by realizing that the Gaussian Kernel implies taking the dot product between the infinite-dimensional mapped points. However, this dot product can be efficiently computed in the input space without explicitly doing the transformation.

I hope this helps clarify the steps involved in the transition between the Gaussian Kernel and its relation to infinite-dimensional space!



# Further explanation
Step 4: Recall the binomial theorem for $(a+b)^2$:

$$(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$

The binomial theorem is a formula that tells us how to expand expressions of the form $(a+b)^n$ into a sum of terms. For example, when $n=2$, we get $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, as stated in this step. This formula is important because it helps us expand expressions that involve powers of sums or differences, such as $(x-y)^2$, which we'll use in the next step.

Step 5: Extend the binomial theorem to infinite dimensions by considering this relationship:

$$(x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$$

In this step, we're using the binomial theorem to expand $(x-y)^2$, which gives us three terms: $x^2$, $-2xy$, and $y^2$. This expansion is useful because it allows us to express the squared Euclidean distance between two points $x$ and $y$ in terms of $x^2$, $y^2$, and the dot product of $x$ and $y$. The dot product is an important concept in linear algebra that measures the similarity between two vectors. By using the binomial theorem to expand $(x-y)^2$, we can rewrite the Gaussian Kernel in terms of the dot product between $x$ and $y$, which is easier to compute.

Step 6: Now, let’s write down $x^2$ and $y^2$ as linear combinations of the aforementioned infinite series. This will help us get the coefficients of the Taylor’s expansion:

$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^{2n} = x^2$$
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n y^{2n} = y^2$$

In this step, we're expressing $x^2$ and $y^2$ as infinite sums of terms, using the same technique we used in Step 3 to express the Gaussian Kernel as an infinite series. The coefficients $c_n$ are constants that depend on the parameter $\sigma^2$ in the Gaussian Kernel. By writing $x^2$ and $y^2$ as infinite sums of terms, we can express the mapping function $\phi(x)$ as an infinite-dimensional vector with an infinite number of components, where each component is a power of $x$ multiplied by a constant coefficient $c_n$. This infinite-dimensional vector represents the mapping of $x$ into the infinite-dimensional feature space.

Step 7: So, the mapping function $\phi(x)$ can be defined as:

$$\phi(x) = [1, \sqrt{c_1}x, \sqrt{c_2}x^2, \sqrt{c_3}x^3, \dots]$$

Using this mapping function, we can rewrite the Gaussian Kernel as:

$$K(x, y) = \phi(x) \cdot \phi(y)$$

In this step, we define the mapping function $\phi(x)$ explicitly as an infinite-dimensional vector with an infinite number of components, as described in Step 6. We then use this mapping function to rewrite the Gaussian Kernel as the dot product of two infinite-dimensional vectors $\phi(x)$ and $\phi(y)$. This dot product represents the similarity between the two points $x$ and $y$ in the infinite-dimensional feature space.
