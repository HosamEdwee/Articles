Let’s break the steps down further to understand the connections better.

1. Start with the Gaussian Kernel Function:

$$
K(x, y) = \exp\left(-\frac{||x-y||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

2. Rewrite the Gaussian Kernel using the Taylor expansion of the exponential function:

$$
\exp(-z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n z^n}{n!}
$$

In our case, $z = \frac{||x-y||^2}{2\sigma^2}$

3. So, the Gaussian Kernel Function can be expressed as an infinite series:

$$
K(x, y) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \left(\frac{||x-y||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)^n
$$

Now, let’s define a mapping function $\phi$ that projects the input data $x$ into infinite-dimensional space. We’ll use the binomial theorem to help with the transition.

4. Recall the binomial theorem for $(a+b)^2$:

$$
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

5. Extend the binomial theorem to infinite dimensions by considering this relationship:

$$
(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2
$$

6. Now, let’s write down $x^2$ and $y^2$ as linear combinations of the aforementioned infinite series. This will help us get the coefficients of the Taylor’s expansion:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^{2n} = x^2
$$

$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n y^{2n} = y^2
$$

It’s important to understand that the actual mapping function, $\phi(x)$, comes from these infinite series representations of $x^2$ and $y^2$.

7. So, the mapping function $\phi(x)$ can be defined as:

$$
\phi(x) = \left[1, \sqrt{c_1}x, \sqrt{c_2}x^2, \sqrt{c_3}x^3, \ldots\right]
$$

Using this mapping function, we can rewrite the Gaussian Kernel as:

$$
K(x, y) = \phi(x) \cdot \phi(y)
$$

Although numerous steps occur in between, the key to understanding the connection comes by realizing that the Gaussian Kernel implies taking the dot product between the infinite-dimensional mapped points. However, this dot product can be efficiently computed in the input space without explicitly doing the transformation.

I hope this helps clarify the steps involved in the transition between the Gaussian Kernel and its relation to infinite-dimensional space!
